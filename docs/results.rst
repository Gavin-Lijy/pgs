Expected Results
================

A successful PGS execution will generate a ``result/`` folder which composed of 4 subfolders: 

- ``probMat/`` : contains the input hdf5 TAD-TAD probability matrix (if option 1 or 2 is used).

- ``actDist/`` : contains intermediate files generated by A-step (restraint assignment step). A file is generated at each A/M iteration, and will be used in the subsequent M-step (model optimization).

- ``structure/`` : contains structure information files. One ``.hms`` file has snapshot coordinates of a model with different optimization steps depending on theta parameters.

- ``report/`` : contains preliminary analysis with some plots.


The following we describe results under ``report/`` folder.

heatmap
-------

Contains genome-wide heat map plots of contact probabilities, calculated from both the model population and experiment data (input matrix). A figure showing density scatter plots (log-log scale) as a comparison between them is also provided.


intraMatrix
-----------

Contains heat map plots of contact probabilities for every chromosome, calculated from both the model population and experiment data (input matrix).



radialPlot
----------

Contains scater plots of mean radial position of all TADs, organized by chromosomes in pdf files. The mean radial positions are also recorded in a text file ``radialPlot_summary.txt``.


violations
----------

Contains a text file that tells the average portion of violated restraints per model.
