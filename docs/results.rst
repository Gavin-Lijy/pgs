Expected Results
======================

A successful PGS execution will generate a ``result`` folder which composed of 4 subfolders: 

- ``probMat`` : contains the input hdf5 TAD-TAD probability matrix (if option 1 or 2 are used).

- ``actDist`` : contains intermediate files generated by A-step.

- ``structure`` : contains structure information files. One ``.hms`` file has snapshot coordinates of a model with different optimization steps depending on theta parameters.

- ``report`` : contains preliminary analysis with some plots.


Once all PGS tasks are completed (e.g. "Workflow successfully completed all tasks" printed on the screen or in ``pyflow.data/logs/pyflow_log.txt``), users can analyze the final structures using alberlab analysis tools. The following are some examples of how to extract information from the structure-population.
